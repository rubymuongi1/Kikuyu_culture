            <h3 class="qa-title">How has social media contributed to cultural disconnect</h3>
            <p class="qa-text">
                Social media platforms have facilitated the spread of Western ideals, values, and cultural norms worldwide. As a result, traditional cultures and practices are often overshadowed or replaced by dominant Western influences, leading to a loss of cultural diversity and identity. </br>
                    Social media has facilitated the rapid spread of cultural appropriation, where elements of one culture are adopted or commodified by individuals from another culture without proper understanding or respect. This can lead to the commodification and exploitation of cultural symbols, practices, and identities, further contributing to cultural disconnect and misunderstanding.
